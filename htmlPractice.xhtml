        <h1><u>Why I love tunnels so much</u></h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>    
        <p>
            In my mind, there is nothing better in life than driving through a tunnel. Maybe that's just me. The rush you get when you're driving and all of a sudden you are encapsulated by a haze of yellow light. The lights rush by like a picture book, and my mind gets transported into the tunnel. For those brief moments, life slows down and I am at peace. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always loved tunnels. Growing up in northeastern Ohio, tunnels were few and far between. However, on roadtrips, the possibility of a tunnel excited me greatly. Those hazy yellow lights have a special place in my heart. As soon as you enter, your environment immediately shifts. Your senses are heightened, those lights are shimmering in that beautiful hazy way, and life is complete. Now, walking through tunnels is also cool, but the rush you get while driving is just incomparable.

        <h2>
            The Duality of Tunnels
        </h2>
        <p>
            The fact that tunnels can be enjoyed day or night underlies the duality in them. During the daytime, driving through a tunnel transports you to the dark, shrouded by glimmering lights, as if daylight is shining through the pores of the earth into the tunnel. However, at night, you may be driving and everything is illuminated by only front beams and the occasional streetlight. Then, you are engulfed into a slightly brighter universe. It's a small reminder that light can still pierce through, letting you know there is light even in the darkest places.

            <h2>
                Tunnels in Pop Culture
            </h2>
           <p>
             One of the biggest proponents of my love for tunnels has come from the movie, <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em> (2012). The first picture depicts a scene from the end of the movie. This is an incredible movie to begin with, and I definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't. There are multiple mentions to a tunnel and the characters are depicted driving through the tunnel as an escape from the reality of their lives. Towards the end of the movie, the group of friends finds the perfect "Tunnel Song" to play while driving through the tunnel. This song is "Heroes" by David Bowie. It is a euphoric moment as they open the hood and feel the wind on their faces and the illumination of those yellow lights flickers past them at a high speed. Fun fact: This tunnel scene was filmed in Pittsburgh, through the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
