                The Duality of Tunnels
            </h2>
            <p>
                The fact that tunnels can be enjoyed day or night underlies the duality in them. During the daytime, driving through a tunnel transports you to the dark, shrouded by glimmering lights, as if daylight is shining through the pores of the earth into the tunnel. However, at night, you may be driving and everything is illuminated by only front beams and the occasional streetlight. Then, you are engulfed into a slightly brighter universe. It's a small reminder that light can still pierce through, letting you know there is light even in the darkest places.
