             One of the biggest proponents of my love for tunnels has come from the movie, <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em> (2012). The first picture depicts a scene from the end of the movie. This is an incredible movie to begin with, and I definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't. There are multiple mentions to a tunnel and the characters are depicted driving through the tunnel as an escape from the reality of their lives. Towards the end of the movie, the group of friends finds the perfect "Tunnel Song" to play while driving through the tunnel. This song is "Heroes" by David Bowie. It is a euphoric moment as they open the hood and feel the wind on their faces and the illumination of those yellow lights flickers past them at a high speed. Fun fact: This tunnel scene was filmed in Pittsburgh, through the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
